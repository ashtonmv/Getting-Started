You haven't given up after day one, which is a great sign!

The objectives for this part don't require you to have any Hipergator or Stampede account, so they're great for doing while you're waiting on your accounts to open up.

----------

1. Now would be a great time to start learning **Linux/command line** and **Python**, if you don't already know them well. Our favorite resource for learning different languages is Codecademy, which has excellent free courses on both [Linux](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) and [Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python). You will almost definitely be using both of these languages while you're working in the group. Linux/command line is for navigation on your computer and Python is for pretty much everything else. You will get a lot more comfortable with them over time, but these courses will help you get started.
It might take you a week or two to finish these courses, so it might be best to keep working on them as you advance through the other getting started objectives.

2. It will also benefit you greatly to learn vim or emacs. These are programs for editing text files from the command line environment and you will use them all the time. There are several good tutorials out there, like [openvim](https://openvim.com) and [GNU's emacs tour](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/).
